Crap, looks like your browser doesn't do canvas. Sorry about all this, but it's going to be quite impossible to play the game without that capability.

	<p>Squarely is a mild-mannered square, with a red pulse of life. He needs help doing... some currently-undefined objective. Please, help guide him in his quest (or whatever)!</p>
	<p>Controlling Squarely is a simple matter of pressing the arrow keys in the direction you would like him to go. Alternatively, you could press the W,A,S, and D keys.</p>
	<p>In addition to being able to move around, Squarely can also change size. When he presses up against a blue block, he grows. When he presses against a yellow one, he shrinks. The larger he is, the faster he can move. Being smaller allows our brave hero to navigate smaller hallways.</p>
